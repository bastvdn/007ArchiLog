# 007 rpg

rpg version of the famous playground game 007.
We have improved the base game with a new feature but we have
kept the basic spirit of this one: attack, reload and defend.

You play as a hero of your choice with certain basic stats, you
fight and loot original Mobs with armor and stat-boosting weapons.
