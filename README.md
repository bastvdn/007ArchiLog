# 007 rpg

rpg version of the famous playground game 007.
We have improved the base game with a new feature but we have
keep the basic spirit of this one: attack, recharge and defend.

You play as a hero of your choice with certain basic stats, and
fight original Mobs with armor and stat-boosting weapons
the entity that wears them.
